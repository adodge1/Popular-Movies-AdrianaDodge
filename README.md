In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.

App requests for related videos for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/videos endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.

App requests for user reviews for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/reviews endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.

Data Persistence
